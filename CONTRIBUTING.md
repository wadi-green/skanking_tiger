#### As a developer or designer ? 
- I beleive in transparency. The entire app code base can be found at [Skanking Tiger](https://github.com/wadi-green/skanking_tiger)
- Some Projects have been created to organize tasks. Intention is to keep things organized in a kanban board style in one board and then move the issue to relevant project board

# Do you love to teach and write?

All the `Activities` in the system is content created by a variety of people from all across the world, 21 to be precise, from 5 different countries. 
The more `Activities` we create, the better it is for people. Help me in finding new ones, proof-reading and managing them.
