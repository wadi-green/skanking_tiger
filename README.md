A lifestyle networking application.

## Documentation

All of this project's documentation lives under the `docs` folder. In order to view them, open a terminal
inside the `docs` folder, then run the following commands:
1. `npm install --also=dev`
2. `npm run dev`

After that, you can read the documentation at the address it shows you in the terminal (usually `http://localhost:8080/`).

If you want to generate the docs and host them somewhere, you can execute `npm run build`. The output will
be generated under `docs/src/.vuepress/dist/` as a static HTML site.  
PS: In order to view it locally, you'll need to use something like [http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server).
