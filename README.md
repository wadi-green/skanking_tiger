## How it works

The aim is to provide people with a plateform where they can teach & learn about different sustainable life-styles that everyone around the world are accustomed to.

1. Go through the search page and try searching for a topic that interests you e.g `plastic`, `pollution` or `energy`
2. Found what you were looking for? Time to get your hands dirty. Sign-up with the app, , read the steps and start working ! 
3. Each step has points that add to your karma points, do more, earn more karma !
4. Have another brilliant idea to share with others ? Tell us and we will add it to our [Activities](https://github.com/wadi-green/Wadi.Green/wiki/Activities), send an email to support@wadi.green

## Documentation

All of this project's documentation lives under the `docs` folder. In order to view them, open a terminal
inside the `docs` folder, then run the following commands:
1. `npm install --also=dev`
2. `npm run dev`

After that, you can read the documentation at the address it shows you in the terminal (usually `http://localhost:8080/`).

If you want to generate the docs and host them somewhere, you can execute `npm run build`. The output will
be generated under `docs/src/.vuepress/dist/` as a static HTML site.  
PS: In order to view it locally, you'll need to use something like [http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server).
